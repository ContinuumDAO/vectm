/**
 * @title CTMDAOGovernor
 * @notice Governance contract for the Continuum DAO using veCTM voting power
 * @dev This contract implements a comprehensive governance system that combines multiple
 * OpenZeppelin Governor extensions to provide robust DAO governance capabilities.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Multi-signature proposal execution with customizable thresholds
 * - Time-weighted voting using veCTM token voting power
 * - Late quorum prevention mechanism
 * - Configurable proposal and voting periods
 * - Support for multiple proposal types and execution methods
 * - Integration with veCTM voting escrow system
 * 
 * Governance parameters:
 * - Voting delay: 5 days (432,000 seconds)
 * - Voting period: 10 days (864,000 seconds)
 * - Proposal threshold: 1% of total voting power (1000 basis points)
 * - Quorum threshold: 20% of total voting power
 * - Late quorum extension: 2 days (172,800 seconds)
 * 
 * The contract inherits from multiple OpenZeppelin Governor extensions to provide
 * a complete governance solution with advanced features like late quorum prevention
 * and multiple counting mechanisms.
