# NodeProperties

## Overview

The NodeProperties contract manages the attachment of veCTM tokens to MPC node infrastructure for reward distribution. It allows veCTM token holders to attach their tokens to node infrastructure, enabling them to receive additional rewards based on node performance and quality metrics.

## Contract Details

- **Contract**: `NodeProperties.sol`
- **Inherits**: `INodeProperties`
- **License**: BSL-1.1
- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.27

## Data Structures

### `NodeInfo`
```solidity
struct NodeInfo {
    string forumHandle;
    string email;
    bytes32 nodeId;

    string vpsProvider;
    uint256 ramInstalled;
    uint256 cpuCores;
    string dIDType;

## Usage

The NodeProperties contract enables node infrastructure integration:

1. **Token-Node Attachment**: veCTM token holders can attach their tokens to MPC node infrastructure
2. **Quality Tracking**: Governance can track and update node quality scores over time
3. **Reward Eligibility**: Attached tokens become eligible for additional node-based rewards
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Historical quality scores enable performance-based reward calculations
5. **Node Management**: Governance can manage node attachments and removals

## Integration

The NodeProperties contract integrates with:

- **VotingEscrow**: For token ownership verification and voting power checks
- **Rewards**: For node reward threshold validation and reward distribution
- **Governance**: For administrative functions and node quality management
- **Checkpoints**: For historical quality score tracking

## Security Considerations

- Uses governance-only access controls for administrative functions
- Validates token ownership before allowing attachments
- Implements proper threshold checking for node eligibility
- Uses checkpointed quality scores for historical tracking
- Prevents duplicate attachments and invalid node IDs
- Implements removal request mechanism for node operators
