# VotingEscrow

## Overview

The VotingEscrow contract implements a time-weighted voting escrow system for veCTM tokens. Users lock CTM tokens to receive veCTM NFTs with voting power that decays linearly over time. The system supports both voting and non-voting locks, delegation mechanisms, and integration with governance systems.

**Returns:**
- `uint256[]`: The filtered array

### `_push(mapping(address => ArrayCheckpoints.TraceArray) storage self, function(uint256[] memory, uint256[] memory) internal pure returns (uint256[] memory) op, uint256[] memory deltaTokenIDs) internal returns (uint256, uint256)`

Pushes a checkpoint update.

**Parameters:**
- `self` (mapping): The checkpoint mapping
- `op` (function): The operation function
- `deltaTokenIDs` (uint256[]): The token IDs to update

**Returns:**
- `(uint256, uint256)`: The old and new balance lengths

## Events

- `Withdraw(address indexed _provider, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _value, uint256 _ts)`: Emitted when tokens are withdrawn
- `Supply(uint256 _prevSupply, uint256 _supply)`: Emitted when supply changes
- `Merge(uint256 indexed _fromId, uint256 indexed _toId)`: Emitted when locks are merged
- `Split(uint256 indexed _tokenId, uint256 indexed _extractionId, uint256 _extractionValue)`: Emitted when a lock is split
- `Liquidate(uint256 indexed _tokenId, uint256 _value, uint256 _penalty)`: Emitted when a lock is liquidated

## Errors

- `VotingEscrow_LockExpired(uint256 _end)`: Lock has expired
- `VotingEscrow_InvalidMerge(uint256 _from, uint256 _to)`: Invalid merge operation
- `VotingEscrow_VotingAndNonVotingMerge(uint256 _from, uint256 _to)`: Cannot merge voting and non-voting locks
- `VotingEscrow_SameToken(uint256 _from, uint256 _to)`: Cannot merge same token
- `VotingEscrow_DifferentOwners(uint256 _from, uint256 _to)`: Tokens have different owners

## Modifiers

- `nonreentrant()`: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- `nonflash(uint256 _tokenId)`: Prevents flash NFT attacks
- `onlyGov()`: Restricts access to governance only
- `checkNotAttached(uint256 _tokenId)`: Ensures token is not attached to a node
- `checkNoRewards(uint256 _tokenId)`: Ensures token has no unclaimed rewards

## Usage

The VotingEscrow contract is the core component of the ContinuumDAO governance system:

1. **Token Locking**: Users lock CTM tokens to receive veCTM NFTs with voting power
2. **Voting Power**: Voting power decays linearly over the lock duration
3. **Delegation**: Users can delegate their voting power to other addresses
4. **Governance Integration**: The contract integrates with the governance system
5. **Node Integration**: Tokens can be attached to node infrastructure for additional rewards
6. **Reward Distribution**: The contract integrates with the rewards system

## Security Considerations

- Uses reentrancy guards to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Implements flash protection to prevent flash NFT attacks
- Uses UUPS upgradeable pattern for future upgrades
- Implements proper access controls for administrative functions
- Uses checkpoints for accurate historical voting power calculations
- Implements proper delegation mechanisms with checkpointing
